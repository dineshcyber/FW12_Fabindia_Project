## FW12_Fabindia_Project
Here, I am going to share about my very first construct week at Masai in which we cloned one of the e-commerce web stores — FABINDIA.

## About Website
Fabindia is India’s one of the largest private web-stores, which sells garments, 
furnishings and ethnic products that are made from traditional techniques, skills and hand-based processes by craftspeople across rural India.
